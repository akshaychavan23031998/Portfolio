# Git pre-push report

Date: 2026-07-24

## Verdict

**SAFE TO PUSH AFTER MANUAL REVIEW**

The repository is clean of secrets and generated Git candidates, and every required validation passes. Manual review remains for the intentionally unchanged placeholder production origin and three upstream dependency advisories.

## Repository decisions

| Decision | Paths                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Commit   | Production source, public assets, tests, intentional scripts, documentation, project configuration, package manifest/lockfile, `.env.example`, and the protected reference HTML            |
| Ignore   | Dependencies, Next.js/build output, environment files, Vercel linkage, test/coverage output, generated visual artifacts, logs, TypeScript caches, OS metadata, and local editor/tool state |
| Deleted  | Generated build/test/visual output, debug log, TypeScript build cache, and the dependency installation used before the reproducible validation reinstall                                   |
| Retained | Every source file, all public assets, all tests, all 15 intentional scripts, all documentation, configuration, `.env.local`, empty `.agents/`, and the protected reference HTML            |

The final unstaged candidate set contains **106 files**. Git currently reports one ignored file (`.env.local`); generated paths were removed after validation and their ignore rules were verified using representative paths.

## Safety results

- No configured EmailJS value or other credential was found outside `.env.local`.
- `.env.local` is ignored; `.env.example` has three empty placeholders only.
- Generated output and local dependencies are excluded by `.gitignore`.
- No application implementation or test file changed during this audit.
- No package was removed or upgraded.
- The protected reference SHA-256 remains `E762CF325491DB987B57BDF57A338525498CE1D25C2F18F73FC1658C379EC27B`.

| `npm run typecheck`    | Passed                                                                    |
| `npm test`             | 7 files passed; 18 tests passed                                           |
| `npm run build`        | Passed; 17 static/SSG pages generated                                     |
| `npm run test:e2e`     | 20 passed; 2 desktop-inapplicable mobile tests skipped                    |
| Production preview     | All required routes and representative assets returned expected responses |
| `npm audit`            | 3 high advisories, 0 critical; inherited through Next.js dependencies     |

## Manual review

1. Replace the existing `https://example.com` canonical origin in `src/config/site.ts` with the final Vercel origin before deployment. It was not changed because metadata and behavior changes were explicitly prohibited.
2. Track the PostCSS and Sharp advisories inherited by the installed Next.js version. npm's suggested automatic resolution is an unsafe major downgrade, so no forced fix was applied.

## Recommended Git commands

Review the final candidate list before creating the first commit:

```powershell
git status --short
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/akshaychavan23031998/Portfolio.git
git add .
git status --short
git diff --cached --check
git commit -m "Initial production portfolio"
git push -u origin main
```

If `origin` is added manually before these commands, replace `git remote add origin ...` with:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/akshaychavan23031998/Portfolio.git
```

No Git staging, commit, push, or deployment action was performed by this audit. No Git remote is currently configured.
